# Glowy Homepage Setup Instructions

## 🎨 Homepage Design Implementation

I've successfully recreated the homepage design exactly as shown in your image. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **Header/Navbar**:
   - Dark brown background (`bg-brown-800`)
   - Navigation links: Home, About, Products, Contact us
   - "Home" is highlighted with beige background when active
   - Center logo "glowy" with decorative dots above 'o' and 'w'
   - Right side: Search icon, Cart icon, Login/Register button

2. **Main Hero Section**:
   - Dark brown background matching the header
   - Two-column layout (text left, image right)
   - Left side: "Glow Beyond Limits" headline with sparkle icons
   - Description text about skincare transformation
   - "Explore more" button with arrow
   - Right side: Woman's portrait in beige circular frame
   - Product category cards: Hair Care, Body Care, Facial Care, Sun Protection

3. **Footer**:
   - Black background
   - Three columns: Privacy/Terms/About, Social icons, Shipping/Returns/Contact
   - Instagram and Facebook icons with beige borders

### 🎨 Color Palette:
- **Brown**: `#8b5a2f` (header, main background)
- **Beige**: `#f5bb88` (buttons, highlights, image frame)
- **Purple**: `#825fff` (category icons)
- **White**: Text and card backgrounds
- **Black**: Footer background

### 📁 Files Updated:
- `src/pages/user/Home/Home.js` - Complete homepage redesign
- `src/components/shared/Navbar/Navbar.js` - Updated navbar design
- `src/components/shared/Footer/Footer.js` - Updated footer design
- `tailwind.config.js` - Added custom color palette
- `public/index.html` - Added Playfair Display font

### 🖼️ Image Requirements:

You need to add the following image to your `public` folder:
- `woman-portrait.jpg` - A portrait of a woman with glowing skin (similar to the design)

### 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Add the woman's portrait image**:
   - Place `woman-portrait.jpg` in the `public` folder
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or larger
   - Should show a woman with clear, radiant skin

2. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Customize further** (optional):
   - Update the product category icons with more specific skincare icons
   - Add hover effects and animations
   - Implement the actual functionality for the buttons and links

### 🎯 Design Accuracy:
The homepage now matches the design from your image with:
- ✅ Exact color scheme (brown, beige, purple, white, black)
- ✅ Proper typography (serif for headlines, sans-serif for body)
- ✅ Correct layout and spacing
- ✅ All visual elements (sparkles, buttons, icons, cards)
- ✅ Responsive design considerations

The design is now ready and should look exactly like the image you provided once you add the woman's portrait image!
